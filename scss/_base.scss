/* Base Rules */
/* A Base rule is applied to an element using an element selector, a descendent
 * selector, or a child selector, along with any pseudo-classes. It doesnâ€™t
 * include any class or ID selectors. It is defining the default styling for
 * how that element should look in all occurrences on the page.
