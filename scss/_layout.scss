/* Layout Rules */

/* CSS, by its very nature, is used to lay elements out on the page. However,
 * there is a distinction between layouts dictating the major and minor
 * components of a page. The minor componentsâ€”such as a callout, or login form,
 * or a navigation item sit within the scope of major components such as a
 * header or footer. I refer to the minor components as Modules and will dive
 * into those in the next section. The major components are referred to as
 * Layout styles.
