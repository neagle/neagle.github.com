<p>I&rsquo;m a dude who needs to write stuff down to remember it. (Seriously: how many times have I had to look up how to change the settings on a VPS to stop timing out my SSH connections so soon?)</p>

<p>I had the immense good fortune to study philosophy and the great books at <a href="http://stjohnscollege.edu">St.&nbsp;John&rsquo;s&nbsp;College</a> (I even had my first web job there as their student webmaster). I&rsquo;ve spent over five years as a full-time front-end developer and web designer (in varying proportions). Right now I&rsquo;m working as a senior front-end developer at <a href="http://www.aol.com">AOL</a>.</p>
